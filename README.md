# Stock-Portfolio

Project Goal: Design and implement a functional application that connects to a SQL database

Abstract:
This application models an investment service than allows users to create a personal stock portfolio. It allows the user to login or sign up with a username/password. Once they login they can edit their information, view basic statistical queries of the transaction table, and write their own queries to filter the list of transactions. Users are also able to "purchase" shares of stocks listed on the S&P 500.  Purchase and sale of stocks are made at the currenmt market price. Users can then view their stock portfolio, which is displayed as a pie chart, and see their total current account value and the values for each stock they hold. They also see their net gain or loss, depending on whether their current account value is greater or less than the total of all their transactions.

Languages/Features:
- Python
- SQLite
- multithreading
